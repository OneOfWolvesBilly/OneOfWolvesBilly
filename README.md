## 🎯 Current Focus

I'm building the [**HarmoniaSuite**](https://github.com/OneOfWolvesBilly/HarmoniaSuite) ecosystem — a comprehensive audio toolchain for macOS and Apple platforms. The foundation is **HarmoniaCore**, a cross-platform audio framework designed for production use.

### 🎵 HarmoniaCore — Cross-Platform Audio Framework

A production-grade audio framework with **identical behavior** on Apple (Swift) and Linux (C++20) platforms.

**Architecture Highlights**:
- ✅ **Ports-based design**: Clean separation between platform logic and business logic
- ⚡ **Real-time safe**: Lock-free, allocation-free audio rendering pipeline
- 🎯 **Platform parity**: Same observable behavior on macOS, iOS, and Linux
- 🧪 **Fully tested**: Comprehensive unit tests with mock implementations

**Technical Stack**:
- **Swift 6**: Strict concurrency, modern async patterns, AVFoundation integration
- **C++20**: RAII, std::optional, FFmpeg/PipeWire adapters (in progress)
- **Audio**: AVFoundation, Core Audio, FFmpeg, TagLib, PipeWire
- **Architecture**: Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters), dependency injection, SOLID

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Core architecture complete
- ✅ Swift implementation production-ready (macOS/iOS)
- ✅ PlaybackService with full state management
- ✅ Metadata reading/writing (Apple platforms)
- 🚧 Linux/C++20 implementation in progress
- 🚧 Cross-platform behavior parity tests

**Key Features**:
- Audio playback with precise position tracking
- Multi-format decoding (MP3, AAC, ALAC, WAV, AIFF, FLAC*)
- Metadata reading/writing (ID3, MP4, Vorbis)
- Unified error handling across platforms
- Thread-safe API design

*FLAC support planned for macOS Pro builds

> 💡 **Why HarmoniaCore?** After 8+ years building distributed systems, I'm applying enterprise-grade architectural patterns to audio software — ensuring maintainability, testability, and true cross-platform support.
